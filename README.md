  1: Java- jdk1.8.0
  2: selenium webdriver-3.141
  3: Eclipes editor- 3.7.2
  4: TestNG: 2.0
  
# Installation:(What things you need to install the software and how to install them)

1:Eclipes Mars@(Editor) :https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/mars/2

2:Selenium-Standanole-server : https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
   This selenium-standalone-server is a .exe file we have to add this file file to our selenium project.
   
3: TestNG : This exe file is used to make report of testing pages

4: ApachePoi : This exe file is used to test the database of the software 
         
         To install above two files follow below steps
            1: Open Eclipes
            2: Help-Eclipes Marketplace from here we can install these files.
            
# Running the tests:(how to run the automated tests for this system)
   
    1: Create a WebDriver instance.
    2: Navigate to a Web page.
    3: Locate an HTML element on the Web page.
    4: Perform an action on an HTML element.
    5: Anticipate the browser response to the action.

    7: Conclude the test.

# Break down into end to end tests(what these tests test and why)
    
    The software testing is done at all the levels of software development with specific objectives at each level. The software project documents are reviewed at each level to identify the errors.
    These Test cases related to the project tests each and every  form of the project to check that the software is running as per the customer requirement or not.

# Usage:
  
 1: Less burden and stress for testers. 
 2: Cost reduction for the Business Clients. 
 3: Increased test coverage. 
 4: Improved testing accuracy.

# Technical task: 
    Automated Software Testing

# Project Status:
    The project is under working phase.
    

### Expanding the task
    I will find ways to improve the testing during the project and will document the process.
